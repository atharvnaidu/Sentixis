The Oslo-based company rose 18\\npercent to 40.5 kroner at 11:37 a.m., giving it a market value\\nof 4.85 billion kroner ($807 million).

The company has a strong balance sheet, and\\ncould be an attractive target for other companies, such as\\n Mountain View , California-based Google, he said.  “A deal would make strategic sense for Facebook,” said\\nNilsen, who doesn’t own shares of either company. “If they want\\nto get their own browser, they have two alternatives: one is to\\nbuild their own browser, which will take some time, and two is\\nto buy a company that has a current browser. Opera is the only\\nindependent player here.”  The Pocket-Lint report cited an unidentified source.  Pal Unanue-Zahl, an Opera spokesman, declined to comment on\\nspeculation. Bethan Thomas, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the\\ncompany doesn’t comment on rumor and speculation.  Increasing Revenue  Opera’s revenue may increase 38 percent this year to 1.24\\nbillion kroner, according to the average  estimate  of analysts in\\na Bloomberg survey. Adjusted earnings per share may rise 50\\npercent to 1.83 krone, according to the survey.  Chief Executive Officer Lars Boilesen has expanded Opera to\\n150 million users a month by targeting faster-growing markets\\nsuch as Russia and  Indonesia  where it is one of the cheapest way\\nto access the Internet, he said in an interview in February. The\\ncompany plans to release improvements to its computer,\\nsmartphone and TV products this year, he said.  An acquisition of a company such as Opera could help\\nFacebook create its own phone or help it improve its services on\\nmobile phones, computers and televisions, said Tony Cripps, a\\nprincipal analyst at Ovum in London.  “To become a real power player in the consumer technology\\nmarket, you need to have a strong presence in the devices\\nthemselves,” Cripps said in an interview. “The Web browser\\nmight be the best route in that it gives you the ability to do a\\nlot of what you can do with an operating system: you can run\\napps and app stores through the Web browser.”  Facebook raised $16 billion in its initial public offering\\nthis month. The company is trying to adapt as more users access\\nits site via mobile phones. That put pressure on executives to\\narticulate their mobile strategy as they marketed the stock to\\npotential investors ahead of the IPO. Facebook has said it will\\nadd mobile advertising along with new ads to reach users when\\nthey log off of the company’s website.
